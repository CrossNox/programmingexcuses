Tired of making up your own excuses? Get them from http://programmingexcuses.com with python!

# Testing
There are no tests! I was gonna make up an excuse for that but this package does it for me :D

Management insisted we wouldn't need to waste our time writing unit tests
```

It's quite simple:  
```python
import programmingexcuses
print(programming_excuses.get_excuse())
```

And, for convenience:
```python
